<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
	<br>
	<p> As a student I have achieved a lot from Internships, freelance and volunteer.One of the freelance project that I have done to completion is a Medical Records Management System that I created solo from the very first step of defining purpose and requirements, to the last phase of Implemenatation. I was able to program a Java Program for a local Clinic and is currently in use. I learnt a lot from the process, from analytics skills to java programming Language and I intend to use this skills to build a career. Other than that, I for one is a camp member of the FreeCodeCamp and so far I have worked for two certificates that is web-design and JavaScript. This experience has tought me much and to add on I have been able to create more sites and projects that are accessible in my github account. </p>

			<h5>Java Project</h5>
			<p>As stated before this is one of the freelance project that I have done to it's completion. A medical Recode system for a local clinic. The system is web-based, that is regulated as a medical device. It is simply a quick and efficient way to obtain patientâ€™s information. It manages the smooth healthcare performance along with medical and legal control. It covers the service that unify and simplify the work of healthcare professionals as well as their interaction with the patients. Some of the parts that make the system are;
				<ul>
				<li>MySql</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>LAN</li>
			</ul>
</p>

			<h5>Web design pages</h5>
			<p>web design pages are mostly about the interface that the user interact with and they are suppose to be fairly easy to manipulate. when creating web pages this is what is suppose to be in the mind of the designer.Most of my web pages that you can interact with are hosted in github and are found in my github account. I will list some of the links here so that you can easily acess them.

					<li><a href="https://gigoles.github.io/tom-mboya-tribute.github.io/">Tribute page</a></li>

				<p>This final link is for the certification aquired from FreeCodeCamp.</p>

			<h5>JavaScript</h5>
			<p>JavaScript, yes the scripting language. I have been certified with FreeCodeCamp and besides that I have invested time in reading and analying Danny Goodman 3rd Edition JavaScript Bible. This is just but creating a foundation for the a career in programming. JavaScript being more mathematical and interactive with the computer is facinating and I am estatic to be part of tge large community that takes JavaScript as a major. As a student taking JavaScript,  I believe that it plays a major role to web design,front-End development and so much more. To see some of the projects that I have worked on in JavaScript scripting language you can them in my github page listed on my socials </p>
